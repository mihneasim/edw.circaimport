Dear Groupware Manager,

Your IG Data export has been completed. The export contains all the data from this location:

<span tal:replace="options/ob_url" />

You need to access "Export/Import IG Data" on the destination server and pick
the location where data will be imported.
You will be requested the path to the exported zexp file:

<span tal:replace="options/zexp_path" />

If you have any difficulties, please contact Helpdesk or the Groupware developers.
